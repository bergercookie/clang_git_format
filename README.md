# clang_git_format - Python wrapper for bulk reformatting of Git repos

Current repository offers an automated solution to the reformatting of entire
projects managed by Git. It was inspired by [the series of
articles](https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/succeeding-with-clangformat-part-1-pitfalls-and-planning/)
of how MongoDB used clang-format to reformat their codebase. As a backbone for
this package, the MongoDB
[clang_format.py](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/buildscripts/clang_format.py)
has been used.
